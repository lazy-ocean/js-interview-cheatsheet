# HTML

> HTML - Hypertext Markup Language

## WAI-ARIA

ARIA - Accessbile Rich Internet Applications Suite, it defines a way to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities.

## HTML5 - what's new

- Rich content without additional plugins (Flash is deprecated), `<video>`, `<audio>` support
- Better semantic support with tags (header, main, nav, article, section, aside, footer, details, figure)
- Better cross-platform support
- New form controls: calendar, date, time, email, color, url etc

## Web-workers

Web-workers are some scripts or functions, chunks of JS-code that execute asynchronously in the background.

## Semantic elements

Semantic elements are designed to provide meaning of the elements to browsers, screenreaders, search engines, printing functionality, voice assistants, developers and users, too. It improves clarity and sections content into meaningful areas.

- `header`, `footer`, `main`
- `nav`: site menu, might have multiple but not nested.
- `article`: self contained content, can be used alone without losing meaning.
- `section`: grouping of other elements. Usually stand-alone blocks of info.
- `aside`: something that is not in the main context or info flow, adv block or some notes.
- `figure` and `figcaption`: some bits of info, might be a photo or a code, diagram with a caption.
- `strong` instead of `bold`, `em` instead of `i`, `del` instead of `s`.
- specific ones: `q` and `blockquote`, `address`, `time`, `code`.

## ID vs class

ID is unique and used only once, class can and should be reused.  
ID has only one element, classes may be used in combinations  
ID has more weight in CSS.

## Inline and block elements

Inline: a, br, i, time, button, img, span, select.  
Block: div, footer, header, main, section, article, aside, nav, form, table, h1-h6, ul-ol li, p, figure
