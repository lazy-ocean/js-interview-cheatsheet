# HTML tags

## `<main>`

Main content of the page, not more than one on the page according to W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).

## `<alt>` attribute

Could be empty when the image is used only for the decorative purposes and is not really the content of the page. So, if you have a border of some kind or a separator in text, it is better to leave empty for screenreaders to skip.

## Non-closing tags ('empty elements')

`<area>`, `<br>`, `<col>`, `<source>`, `<img>`, `<meta>`
