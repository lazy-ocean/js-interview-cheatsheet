# Design patterns

## Patterns breakdown

> Patterns are reusable and recognized solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design.

### Categorization

#### Creational patterns

Creating objects and optimizing mechanisms to work with a single or a group of objects.

#### Structural patterns

Dictate relationships between chunks and modules and what not. Ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't have to change along with it.

#### Behavioral patterns

Implementing and improving communication between parts of the system in the situations where sharing is required (synchronized data and so on).

#### Concurrency patterns

Support and implement solutions for multi-threaded programming paradigms (not sharing everything in your system but partitioning and isolate first and merge later when/if needed).

#### Architectural patterns

Implementing best engineering/architectural practices.
