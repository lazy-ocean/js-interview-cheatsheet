## Common data structures

- **Array**

  Numerically indexed collections of values, in JS can contain a mix of different data types

- **Stack**

  Array with a last-in-first-out principle applied

- **Queue**

  Array with a first-in-first-out principle applied

- **Set**

  Unordered collection of unique values

- **Object**

  key-value data structure, an unordered structure to store some data in a collection with a unique string name

- **Map**

  Objects with any type of unique values as keys + in JS ordered based on the original insertion order of the keys

- **Tree**

  Hierarchical data structure allowing unidirectional connections (a child has one parent, due to that there exists exactly one path between any two nodes).

- **Graph**

  Non-linear data structure allowing multi-relational connections (a node can have multiple relations)
