# JS Fundamentals

## Data types

#### 1. Primitives

- Number:
  - numbers
  - floating point numbers
  - positive and negative infinity (when dividing by 0 or set explicitly)
  - NaN (wrong math operations, operations with NaNs)
- BigInt - any number >/< of 2^53-1.
  To announce `BigInt` add n at the end of the number:

```
const bigInt = 4872343298732847239847n
```

- String
- Boolean
- `undefined` - value has not been defined, function that doesn't return anything, unset object property
- Symbol - anonymous, unique value

#### 2. `null`

Usually explicitly set.

#### 3. Structural types

- Object types:
  objects, arrays, maps, sets, date, etc.
- Functions.

Check with `typeof x`

## Tricky comparison operators

**`==` - equality**

Attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different types.

- with objects `true` only if they're the same objects
- number with string - string converts to number

**`===` - identity**

Strict identity, items of different types are always different.

**Null & undefined:**

```
null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false

null == null || null === null // true
undefined == undefined || undefined === undefined // true

0 == null // false
0 == undefined // false
```

## ECMAScript2015 (ES6)

What's new:

- Arrow functions
- Classes
- Template strings

Those with '``' - grave accents, available to concatenate different parts into a single string:

```
console.log(`Hi ${name}!`)
```

- Enhanced Object Literals

So `{ cat: cat, meow: meow }` works just like `{ cat, meow }`

- Destructuring

```
let [blah1, blah2, blah3] = arr;
let [head, ...tail] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let { firstName, lastName, position, yearHired } = employee
```

- Promises
- Generators (function\*)

```
function* generator(i) {
  yield i;
  yield i + 10;
}

const gen = generator(10);
console.log(gen.next().value); // expected output: 10
console.log(gen.next().value); // expected output: 20
```

- Modules (import and export)

Earlier worked with CommonJS-NodeJS & AMD

- Symbol
- Sets

Collections of unique values, use delete(), add(), has(), size() and clear() methods.

```
const set1 = new Set()
const set2 = new Set(['a','b','c','d','d','e']) // => ['a','b','c','d','e']
```

- Default values
- Rest & Spread
- Let & Const

## Event loop

Stack-Heap-Queue dynamics + event loop as it is: dequeue event, call its callback and pop next item from the call stack.

## AJAX

AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the `XMLHttpRequest` object to communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and text files. AJAXâ€™s most appealing characteristic is its "asynchronous" nature, which means it can communicate with the server, exchange data, and update the page without having to refresh the page.
