# React JS

## Why React

1. Virtual DOM - re-rendering DOM only with the different nodes, not the whole tree.
2. Interfaces as functions = easily reusable and stateful components
3. It is JS-based, it doesn't expand JavaScript as Angular JS does.
4. JSX is simple to use and understand
5. React Native exists
6. Well defined lifecycle (render, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount, componentDidUpdate, etc ===> useState, useEffect, useMemo)
7. Easy to test (Jest, Enzyme)
